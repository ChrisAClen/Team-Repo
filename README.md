Repo for eMNY e-Banking App

## About the Project
MNY is a new kind of bank, allowing members to take control of their finances and get ahead by making money management easy and intuitive.
Along with checking and high yield savings accounts we also provide goal based budgeting making it easier to meet those long term spending goals.
Each account will also provide their userâ€™s with the ability to make deposits, withdrawals and for transactions to take place between and from accounts.
With our goal based budgeting system you can finally say hello to that vacation you've always been looking forward to.
Ultimately, the goal of this app is to make the banking process easier and faster than ever for users.
